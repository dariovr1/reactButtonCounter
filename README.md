# reactButtonCounter
a simple button with counter. If the max element sets in state inside constructor is less then the actual counter number, the counter number will be increased. If great, will be decreased.

A perfect example for understand better the react components and the lifecycle of react (state, prevState and props). In this example, props doesn't used. However, is possible create a few buttons and then set one or two params for max and min value.

Enjoy!
