This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

i created this mini project for helps newcomers with React.

In this example i show  how to use setState for manage the prevState of a component (in this case, counter variable) ed do two different action: increase and decrease.


Enjoy
